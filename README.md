# Update 加油 ("jiā yóu") Events

Google Apps Script for batch updating events. Modify as needed.

## Getting Started

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/), and create a new project.
2. Copy and paste [the script](./Code.gs) into the editor.
3. Modify the calendar name. (By default, it is "JIA YOU." Recommended, if you had created events on an alternate calender.  ***Must name it differently from the owner name, otherwise the script will not update events.***)
4. Modify the search query. (By default, it is "New Meeting." Specifically, `myNewQuery = "New Meeting";`)
5. Modify the events' title, location, description, start time, and end time. (By default, events are newly titled "Updated Meeting," located at "Updated location," described as "Updated agenda," start at 9am, and end at 10am.)
6. Save and run the script. (Requires authorization.)
